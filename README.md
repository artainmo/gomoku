Gomoku game website. Using min-max AI algorithm to simulate a dominant gomoku player.

I will create a static webpage as GUI so it can be deployed using github-pages. Also I will use python as it is more convenient for algorithm/AI projects.<br>
As web framework I will use python flask over python django as python flask is sufficient for what I need and is faster to setup. It contains a bundle method allowing static deployment using github-pages and simple frontend which suffices for this project.

## Preliminary Notions
### Gomoku
Gomoku is also called five-in-a-row. It is played on a Go board by two players.<br>
Go is an abstract strategy game in which the aim is to surround more territory than the opponent. The game was invented in China 4,500 years ago and is believed to be the oldest board game continuously played to the present day. The conventional board has a size of 19x19, the number of legal board positions in Go has been calculated to be approximately 2.1x10^107. 

Different versions and rules around the game exist. To generalize, the main goal of this game is to be the first player to place five pawns in a row on the board horizontally, vertically or diagonally.
